    <p>The special characters used in this orthography, and the key sequences to enter them with this keyboard, are</p>

    <p>Note that the word-forming apostrophe that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe#Unicode">preferred by the Unicode standard</a> is <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+02BC">the modifier letter apostrophe U+02bc</a>, not the straight <a href="https://www.compart.com/en/unicode/U+0027">apostrophe U+0027</a>, used here to indicate a glottal stop.</p>
    <p>The other non-English word-forming character used in this orthography is the colon, used to indicate vowel length. Since this can be entered with a normal US keyboard, no special keystroke is required for it.</p>
    <p>The keystrokes are intended to resemble the keystrokes that are used in the <a href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ipa" target="_blank">SIL IPA Keyman keyboard</a>.</p>
