    <p>The other non-English word-forming characters used in this orthography are the colon (to indicate vowel length) and the apostrophe (to indicate a glottal stop). Since these can be entered with a normal US keyboard, no special keystrokes are required for them.</p>
    <p>The keystrokes are intended to resemble the keystrokes that are used in the <href="https://keyman.com/keyboards/sil_ipa" target="_blank">SIL IPA Keyman keyboard</a>.</p>
